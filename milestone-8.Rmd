## Looking at Gothic Literature

Downloading books I want to look at from the gutenbergr package. Books I am looking at in this are *Frankenstein*, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, *Carmilla*, *The Phantom of the Opera*, and *Dracula*.

## Gutenberg Book ID Numbers

1. Frankenstein 84
2. The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 43
3. Carmilla 10007
4. The Phantom of the Opera 175
5. Dracula 345

```{r, inclue=FALSE, message=FALSE}

gothic <- gutenberg_download(c(84, 43, 10007, 175, 345))

frankenstein <- gutenberg_download(84)
jekyllhyde <- gutenberg_download(43)
carmilla <- gutenberg_download(10007)
phantom <- gutenberg_download(175)
dracula <- gutenberg_download(345)

## downloading the books into one big data set and then into separate data sets

tidy_gothic <- gothic %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

tidy_frankenstein <- frankenstein %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

tidy_jekyllhyde <- jekyllhyde %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

tidy_carmilla <- carmilla %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

tidy_phantom <- phantom %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

tidy_dracula <- dracula %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)

## tidying words so I can pick through them at my leisure

```

New R chunk so that I dont have to reload the data as I play with it

```{r}

tidy_gothic %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
  
## checking the most common words across all five texts

```

*The Phantom of the Opera* skews the data because Christine and Raoul are in the top ten most frequent words! Moving on to look at each book individually.

Have just discovered that gutenbergr does not count pronouns or articles in its word count which is tragic because I want to look at pronoun usage!!

```{r}

tidy_frankenstein %>% 
   count(word, sort = TRUE)

tidy_jekyllhyde %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

tidy_carmilla %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

tidy_dracula %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

tidy_phantom %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

```

Time is in the top ten for all of them except for in Jekyll and Hyde.

```{r}

dir_create("gothic_app")

write_rds(tidy_gothic, "gothic_app/tidy_gothic.rds")

## made dirctory for gothic shiny app and made file to use in said shiny app

```

And in a shocking turn of events that absolutely no one is surprised by, I can't get my shiny app to run and I do not know what I'm doing wrong. Pasting the code down below so my work is at least visible.

### Setting Choices for Inputs in the UI 



sentiment_choices <- c(
    "Positive" = "positive",
    "Anticipation" = "anticipation",
    "Joy" = "joy",
    "Trust" = "trust",
    "Sadness" = "sadness",
    "Surprise" = "surprise",
    "Anger" = "anger",
    "Fear" = "fear",
    "Disgust" = "disgust",
    "Negative" = "negative"
)


### UI


#### Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(
    theme = shinytheme("flatly"),
    
    navbarPage(
        "Monstrosity of Language in Gothic Lit",
        tabPanel(
            title = "Introduction",
            h5("By Margaret Butler"),
            h3("Summary:"),
            p(
                "Monstrosity in literature, gothic lit in particular, tends to evoke specific images and draws on a very specific linguistic tradition. I was initially curious about tracking shared word usage and pronoun usage in classic gothic novels that investigate the relationship between humanity and monstrosity."
            ),
            p(
                "Pronouns are used in books such as Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* to connote a transition from a character's perception as human to monstrous. I was interested in seeing if this was a tradition one could track statistically in other books or if it was even a a traceable trend that five classic examples of monster literature followed."
            ),
        ),
        
        tabPanel(
            title = "Most Common Words",
            h2("The Most Common Words"),
            p(
                "This word cloud is based on the most common words across *Frankenstein*, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, *The Phantom of the Opera*, *Carmilla*, and *Dracula*."
            ),
            sidebarLayout(
                sidebarPanel(
                    p(
                        "Select sentiment."
                    ),
                    
                    # The pickerInput lets the user pick which sentiments they want to be included in the pie chart
                    # This input is cleaner than check boxer because it collapses like a selectInput but allows you to check multiple similar to checkboxes
                    
                    pickerInput(
                        inputId = "gothic_whole",
                        label = "Select Which Book",
                        choices = sentiment_choices,
                        selected = c("positive", "negative"),
                        multiple = TRUE
                    )
                ),
                mainPanel(
                    h2("Word Cloud"),
                    p(

  ))


###Server




server <- function(input, output) {

            rename(word = Var1) %>%
            inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>%
            filter(sentiment %in% input$multi_sent)
        
        # The wordcloud2 function generates the cloud from a data frame with words along with frequency
        
        wordcloud2(gothic_whole, size = 2)
    })
    
   
    
    
    
    
}
